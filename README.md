# TimeSpendTracker

Chrome extension to track time you've wasted surfing the web.

## Decription and resoning behind the project

I've figured out that I spend to much time surfing sites. The time I've wasted doing this I could spend on learning or doing some side projects. I wanted to see how much time I watched YouTube, scrolled Facebook and readed Reddit. I found a time tracking extension but it would be to easy to me just to install it and use it. I have challenged myself to create my own time tracking extension and meanwhile learn new technologies like React. I hope that you will like my app and see how much time you would have done if you didn't wasted time on the Internet.
